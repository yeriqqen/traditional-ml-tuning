### Version 2.1 - Advanced Preprocessing and Model Tuning

#### Reasoning and Methods
To address the limitations of the initial preprocessing pipeline, advanced techniques were introduced to better handle feature scaling and non-linear relationships. Standardization (z-score) was implemented to ensure features had zero mean and unit variance, improving model convergence. Polynomial feature expansion (degree 2) was added to capture non-linear interactions, and log transformations were applied to reduce the impact of skewed features and outliers.

#### Expectations
These enhancements were expected to improve the performance of models sensitive to feature scaling and non-linearities, such as Logistic Regression and SVM.

#### Outcomes
- Logistic Regression achieved 57.3% validation accuracy, demonstrating improved performance with standardized and polynomially expanded features.
- SVM achieved 54.6% validation accuracy, benefiting from log-transformed features and z-score normalization.
- Ensemble model achieved 53.1% validation accuracy, highlighting the potential of combining multiple models for robustness.

#### Reflections
The introduction of advanced preprocessing techniques led to noticeable performance improvements. Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing model in this version, validating the importance of feature scaling and transformation.

### Version 3.0 - Comprehensive ML Pipeline

#### Reasoning and Methods
This version focused on creating a comprehensive pipeline with advanced feature engineering and systematic hyperparameter tuning. Interaction terms, binning, and k-means clustering were introduced to capture complex relationships. Power transforms (sqrt, square) were applied to enhance feature distributions, and low variance feature removal was used to reduce noise.

#### Expectations
These methods were expected to improve model interpretability and performance by creating more informative features and reducing noise.

#### Outcomes
- Logistic Regression with L2 regularization showed enhanced generalization and reduced overfitting.
