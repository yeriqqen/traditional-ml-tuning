# Machine Learning Model Enhancement Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the systematic enhancement of a machine learning pipeline for achieving the highest possible accuracy on a classification dataset. Through comprehensive feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model optimization, we improved validation accuracy from **57.3%** to **71.56%** - a significant **14.26 percentage point improvement**.

## Initial Baseline Performance

**Starting Point:**

- Best model: Logistic Regression with 57.3% validation accuracy
- Feature preprocessing: Basic polynomial features + standardization
- Model variants: Improved SVM (54.6%), Ensemble (53.1%)

## Enhancement Strategy

### 1. Advanced Feature Engineering

**Motivation:** The original pipeline used only polynomial features. Different types of feature transformations could capture various patterns in the data.

**Implementation:**

- **Low variance feature removal:** Eliminated features with variance < 0.01 to reduce noise
- **Interaction features:** Created selective feature interactions between top 6 features
- **Feature binning:** Converted continuous features into quantile-based bins
- **Power transformations:** Added square root and square transforms
- **K-means clustering:** Added cluster labels and distances as features

**Results:**

```
Preprocessing Variant Performance:
- MinMax scaling: 55.75%
- Standardization: 58.56%
- Log + Standardization: 58.25%
- Polynomial + Standardization: 70.19% ⭐
- Enhanced (interactions + binning): 59.69%
- Power transforms: 63.88%
- K-means clustering: 58.13%
```

**Analysis:** Polynomial features with standardization proved most effective, providing a substantial 12.89 percentage point improvement over basic standardization. This indicates strong nonlinear relationships in the data that benefit from quadratic terms.

### 2. Model Architecture Improvements

#### Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization

**Motivation:** Add regularization to prevent overfitting, especially with polynomial features.

**Implementation:**

```python
# L2 regularized gradient update
dw = (1/n_samples) * np.dot(X.T, (predictions - y)) + l2_lambda * self.weights
```

**Results:** L2 regularization achieved 70.25% accuracy with optimal λ=0.001.

#### Enhanced RBF SVM

**Motivation:** Original RBF SVM had poor convergence and limited iterations.

**Key Improvements:**

- Increased max iterations from 50 to 200
- Added tolerance-based convergence checking
- Implemented better alpha update strategy
- Enhanced margin violation detection

**Results:** Achieved **71.56%** accuracy with C=1.0, γ=0.01 - our best performing model.

### 3. Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning

**Previous Approach:** Fixed hyperparameters with limited exploration
**New Approach:** Systematic grid search across all models

**Tuning Results:**

**Logistic Regression:**

- Learning rates tested: [0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05]
- Best: lr=0.05, iterations=1000 → **70.81%**

**SVM:**

- Learning rate × Regularization combinations tested
- Best: lr=5e-07, reg=10000 → **70.12%**

**RBF SVM:**

- C values: [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]
- γ values: [0.01, 0.1, 1.0]
- Best: C=1.0, γ=0.01 → **71.56%** ⭐

### 4. Advanced Ensemble Methods

**Basic Ensemble:** Simple majority voting between SVM + Logistic Regression

- Result: 69.19%

**Advanced Ensemble:** Weighted voting with three models

- Models: SVM (30%) + LR+L2 (50%) + RBF SVM (20%)
- Result: 70.19%

**Analysis:** Individual RBF SVM outperformed ensembles, suggesting the model captures patterns better than committee approaches.
